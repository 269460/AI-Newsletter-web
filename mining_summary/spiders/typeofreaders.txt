HD Hyundai Construction Equipment Unveils Training Center Utilizing VR and Digital Twin Technologies
SEOUL, Jan. 24 (Korea Bizwire) — HD Hyundai Construction Equipment has opened the doors to an innovative training center that utilizes virtual reality (VR) and digital twin technology for excavator operation instruction and product verification.
The grand opening of the “Virtual Training Center” took place at the HD Hyundai Global R&D Center (GRC) in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province, on January 23, with executives Cho Young-cheul and Lee Dong-wook in attendance, among others.
The center is equipped with 15 RC models of excavators, incorporating the actual operational principles of construction equipment. It features a scaled-down indoor training area replicating real worksites at a 1:14 ratio, a VR experience zone inside an excavator cabin, and a remote-control station for construction equipment.
HD Hyundai XiteSolution mentioned that wearing VR goggles in the indoor training area allows operators to drive RC models with a view identical to that from the cockpit of real machinery, offering an indirect field experience.
Sitting in the excavator cabin in the VR experience zone, trainees can operate construction equipment in a virtual worksite, with on-screen guidance provided for the tasks.
Additionally, the center has established a system that enables the remote control of actual construction equipment located in domestic sites such as the Boryeong testing ground, 130 kilometers away from the GRC.
HD Hyundai XiteSolution plans to conduct training for its employees at this facility, aiming to enhance their understanding and interest in construction equipment.
Moreover, the company plans to elevate product verification by leveraging digital twin technology. Based on actual fieldwork data, they will operate digital twin models and RC models in virtual space for product evaluation and use the gathered data to improve product quality.
Kim Ki-hyung, head of HR Support at HD Hyundai XiteSolution, stated, “We have created a platform for construction equipment training and product verification by integrating digital innovation technologies with construction equipment RC models.”

 Deere sees early strong demand for pay-as-you-go model in precision ag
Deere is offering farmers more financing options for the company’s precision agriculture technology as lower equipment demand weighs on profits.
The world’s largest seller of agriculture equipment launched a Solutions-as-a-Service approach for some of its technology offerings, executives said on an earnings call Thursday. The new business model essentially gives farmers a pay-as-you-go option, lowering upfront costs.
“Our initial experiences have been extremely favorable, as we engage a broader range of customers with our technology,” Aaron Wetzel, vice president of production systems for production and precision ag, said on the call.
The manufacturer has used the pay-as-you-go approach for its precision ag essentials kit, which allows farmers to upgrade their current equipment. Orders for the kit “exceeded our expectations,” CFO Josh Jepsen told investors.
Solutions-as-a-Service will also likely be a key component in Deere’s recent partnership to link its farm equipment up with SpaceX satellites, Jepsen said. Satellite connectivity for farmers in remote areas opens the door for them to use even more precision tools down the line.
“As you enable automation and enable autonomy, that comes with the combination of hardware and the potential for more of a SaaS solution as these things are getting better over time,” Jepsen said.
Deere is working to establish more recurring streams of revenue as demand for traditional farm equipment sours. The company on Thursday cut its annual earnings guidance and is expecting a 15% reduction in net sales for 2024.

Typical summary of article (SO):
Deere is adapting to shifting market conditions by introducing a Solutions-as-a-Service model, which offers a pay-as-you-go financing option for its precision agriculture technology. This approach is designed to reduce upfront costs for farmers and has already seen a positive reception, with orders for its precision ag essentials kit surpassing expectations. The new business model aligns with Deere's strategy to broaden customer engagement and enhance the utility of their products through innovative financing options. Additionally, Deere's recent collaboration with SpaceX to link farm equipment with satellites aims to enhance connectivity and utility of precision tools in remote areas, potentially leading to more automated and autonomous agricultural practices. Amidst these strategic shifts, Deere has revised its financial outlook for 2024, anticipating a 15% drop in net sales and has adjusted its annual earnings guidance downwards.
