Sean McGinnis, Vice President and General Manager of Technology and Global Sales Support at Caterpillar
 told  IM  Editorial Director, Paul Moore: “The market has been growing faster in the past few years as
  mines focus ever more closely on safety. “Today we can detect if an eye closure is just due to dryness or
  itching for example, as opposed to an unplanned or uncontrolled eye closure related to fatigue.”
   He adds on the market itself: “A lot of the focus now is not just on support equipment but also the mid-tier
   miners – including industrial minerals operations and quarries with smaller fleets and smaller classes of machines.
    For us, predictive data has always been more of an assessment tool rather than a commercial offering.
